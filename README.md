# ml-project-unsupervised-learning

Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.



## From the model we developed and the exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted, here are four bullet points as our findings:

    After importing our data using python, we found no missing data. We did however found outliers using the z-score method.
    We used different Data visualization method to determine if there were correlation between the features and in the in the scatter plot grid you can find the correlation between the features. We found “Fresh” and “Milk” to be correlated at a value of 0.1.
    The Heatmap also shows the correlation between the feature. We noticed “milk’ and “grocery” to be correlated at 0.73.
    Noticed another correlation with the “Delicassen” and the “Frozen” feature to be high at 0.39. This suggest they are correlated.
